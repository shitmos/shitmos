# dumb_contracts

Dumb Contracts are tools in the shitmos ecosystem that allow developers to do certain things with blockchains.
They are also features of the cosmos ecosystem, as they are built to interact with the components of the shitmos ecosystem by default.
These dumb contracts can be modified to interact with other assets, but in this repo their default states or origin versions will be programmed to interact with shitmos wallets. shitmos wallets include:

- wallets that hold shitmos nft(s) in them
- wallets that hold shitmos cryptocurrency in them

## list of dumb contracts

1. shitdribble - distributes 22.22 $shitmos to all sez member collections
2. double_dribble - distribute 2.22 $shitmos to all holders of the shitmos nft (2.22 $shitmos per nft held)
3. dingelberries - in cases where some $shitmos is left behind from a double_dribble, these $shitmos accumulate in a dingleberry wallet. the $shitmos in this wallet is distributed when certain conditions are hit. the goal is for this to ocurr programatically, but for now it's to wallets that hold certain traits after a "dingleberry" snapshot.
4. dump - distributes 222 $shitmos to wallets that hold the 3 bibby-shitmos OEs
5. bombs_away - this is actually designed for the $spice ecosystem - an airdrop of $sherpa to $spice holders and lpers
