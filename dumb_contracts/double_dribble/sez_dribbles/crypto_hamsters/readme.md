# how to

1. navigate to the appropriate directory `cd ~/repos/shitmos/dumb_contracts/double_dribble/sez_dribbles/crypto_hamsters`

2. create a text file named `snapshot_<yyyy-mm-dd>.txt`

3. run `create_snapshot.py` after updating the input_file and output_file (i can automate this a bit with a bit more code in the `create_snapshot.py`) file: `python3 create_snapshot.py`

4. run the `double_dribble` code after first changing some of the configuration variables.
