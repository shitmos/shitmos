### How does it work?
Dingleberries is an extension of double_dribble.
For everytime a double_dribble occurs, some of the shitmos gets left behind.
The shitmos left behind is due to listed wallets.
For each listed wallet, there are 2.22 Shitmos left behind as a dingleberry.
Dingleberries accumulate in the dingleberry wallet -> osmo1gz7t9aaqwnmdhn5umm03rqqxd9spkjx3he4xkz
Once a trait is selected via random selection it is announced first in the Proto Towers Discord alpha channel for Shitmos NFT holders.
After a couple of days, it is announced on the public Proto Towers Shitmos channel.
Then telegram.
Then twitter.
Holders of those traits will receive their portion of the dingleberries in the dingleberry wallet.
