# Shitmos on Planq

Shitmos resides on Planq network in a limited fashion. Planq network is a complex network that is not as easy to access compared to other Cosmos SDK networks. It's got a kind of dual thing where the vm the EVM, and thus you need a different wallet (unless you use a dual vm wallet and it works nicely)

For example, most people in cosmos use Keplr, which is more or less just cosmos SDK chains, whereas Planq uses different tech stack components that more align with the Ethereum network. This means many users will need to go through a learning process of either: using EVM wallet like Metamask AND a cosmos wallet like Keplr, or they will need to figure out how dual use works and importing chains and stuff.

Either way, Planq network comes with SIGNIFICANTLY MORE friction compared to a blockchain like Osmosis.
